# Form better habits with habitual Habit Tracker
https://km-habitual.netlify.app/

## Are you keeping track of your new year resolutions? 

habitual is a web application made with HTML, CSS and Javascript, designed to track your habits.
It lets you track how many pages you read, your sleep schedule, exercise, meditation or whatever you want, and shows them on a calendar.

Currently, the app utilizes local storage to save habit data.
I am working on implementing authentication with Firebase, so that you can have access to your habits on multiple devices.

## How to use habitual

To add habits, click the "+ Add Habit" button, and a form pops up.

Habit Name: Enter a name for the habit. Max 10 characters.

Frequency: How often the habit should be done.

Tracking: Set the method for tracking:
* Binary: Simply mark the habit as done (Did you read?)
* Number: Track a number related to the habit (How many pages did you read?)
* Time: Track the timestamp when the habit was done (When did you read?)

Details: Add a description of when, where, what or how to perform the habit.

## Known issues (Work in progress)
* Authentication and cross-device access to data.
* Menu button not functional.
* A bug where the date is set to the first of the current month when switching to previous month.
* The detailed view of each day is a work in progress and does not show numbers or timestamps for habits.
* A light-mode version of the app is being worked on.
