## Are you keeping track of your new year resolutions? 

habitual is a web application made with HTML, CSS and Javascript, designed to track your habits.
It lets you track how many pages you read, your sleep schedule, exercise, meditation or whatever you want, and shows them on a calendar.

Currently, the app utilizes local storage to save habit data.
I am working on implementing authentication with Firebase, so that you can have access to your habits on multiple devices.

## Adding and removing habits
To add a habit, simply click on the "+ Add Habit" button, and a form pops up.
